## Toward Scalable Automatic Modulation Classification via Meta-Learning
This paper is under review.

>**Abstract:** *Driven by recent technological breakthroughs in deep learning (DL), many recent automatic modulation classification (AMC) methods utilize deep networks to classify the type of modulation in the incoming signal at the receiver. However, existing DL-based approaches suffer from limited scalability, especially for unseen modulations or input signals from new environments not used in training the DL model, thus not ready for real-world systems such as software defined radio devices. 
In this paper, we introduce a scalable AMC scheme that provides flexibility for new modulations and adaptability to input signals with diverse configurations. We propose a meta-learning framework based on few-shot learning (FSL) to acquire general knowledge and a learning method for AMC tasks. This approach allows the model to recognize new unseen modulations by learning
with only a very small number of samples, without requiring the entire model to be retrained. Additionally, we enhance the scalability of the classifier by leveraging a transformer-based encoder, enabling efficient processing of input signals with varying configurations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed AMC method outperforms existing techniques across all signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) on RadioML2018.01A dataset.*

## Overview of meta-learning architecture

</div>

- Meta-training : the encoder $f_{\theta}$  learns the metric space using prototypes of each class.
- Meta-testing  : module uses trained $f_{\theta}$ for new unseen modulations with fewer (1-5) collected samples. 


## Few-shot learning evaluation

- This figure shows the results of evaluating 5 random unseen modulations with few shots (1, 5, 10, 15).
- Accuracy is the average value performed 100 times for each test.

- Evaluating the proposed model (**right figure**) using smaller input frames while it was trained with 2x1024 frames.
- The left figure shows the limitations on the input size scalability of CNN-based models.  
- Proposed model only leads to a slight performance degradation, with the minimum difference being approximately **±0.4%**.
